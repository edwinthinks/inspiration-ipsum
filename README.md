## Learning Resources

I like to keep a catalog or record of articles I found useful in my production of the code. I think it is good to give credit to those that helped me :).

- I setup my project with express /w typescript from this [article](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/typescript-with-node-and-express-js-why-when-and-how-eb6bc73edd5d), by Andre Gardi.

- Setup eslint with typescript using this [article](https://javascriptplayground.com/typescript-eslint/)
